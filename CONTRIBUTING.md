# CONTRIBUTING TO AREG SDK

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Areg SDK.  
We welcome developers, companies, researchers, and hobbyists who want to help improve the framework.

This guide explains how to contribute, how copyrights work, and what you need to do so your contribution can be accepted.

---

## 1. Code Licensing

All contributions are licensed under:

**Apache License, Version 2.0**

By submitting a pull request or commit, you agree that your contribution is provided under Apache 2.0.

---

## 2. Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

To contribute, you must confirm that you have the right to submit the code.

Areg SDK uses the **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)**. It is a simple and widely adopted alternative to contributor license agreements.

Every commit must include a `Signed-off-by` line:

```

Signed-off-by: Your Name [email@example.com](mailto:email@example.com)

```

Most Git tools can add this automatically:

```

git commit -s

```

By signing off, you state that your contribution is your original work or that you have permission to submit it.  
More information can be found at https://developercertificate.org/

## 3. Copyright Headers

You may add a copyright header if you want your name or organization to appear in the source file.

If you prefer not to add a header, the project may include a default header for clarity and consistent licensing.  
This does not affect your ownership or your rights in any way.

Example of an optional header:

```cpp
/************************************************************************
 * This file is part of the Areg SDK core engine.
 * Areg SDK is dual licensed under Apache 2.0 and commercial licenses.
 *
 * \copyright   (c) 2017-2026 Your Name or Aregtech UG
 * \file        path/to/YourFile.hpp
 * \ingroup     Areg SDK
 * \author      Your Full Name or GitHub ID
 * \brief       Brief description
 ************************************************************************/
```

Minor edits such as typo fixes, grammar corrections, formatting cleanup, comment updates, CMake changes, and YAML updates do not require contributor copyright headers.
