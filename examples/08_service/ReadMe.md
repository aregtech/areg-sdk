# 08_service Project Overview

The **[08_service](./08_service)** project demonstrates the use of simple local *Service Provider* objects within **multithreaded** applications. It involves creating a *dummy* (empty) *Local Service Interface* object, which is only accessible within the process and not visible externally.

The service is registered within a *model* that is loaded when the application starts and is unloaded when the task completes.
