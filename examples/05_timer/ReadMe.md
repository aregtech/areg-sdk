# 05_timer Project Overview

The **05_timer** project demonstrates how to implement and manage timers (or **Timer Events**) in **multithreaded applications** using the AREG Framework. This example showcases the initialization, execution, processing and termination of multiple timers. It highlights how to trigger a timer within the thread concept and how to process the timer event after timeout expiration.

## Key Concepts

- **Timer Management**: Learn how to initialize, start, and stop different types of timers in a **multithreaded environment**.
- **Timer Service**: The project relies on the *Timer Service* (or *Timer Manager*), which must be active to handle and manage timer events within different threads.
- **Thread-Specific Timers**: Each timer runs in the thread of its respective owner, ensuring that timers are handled in a thread-safe manner.

## Types of Timers

The project includes examples of different types of timers:

- **One-time Timer**: Executes a task only once and then stops. This is useful for scheduling a single delayed task.
- **Periodic Timer**: Executes a task repeatedly for a specified number of iterations, ideal for tasks that need to run on a set schedule.
- **Continuous Timer**: Runs indefinitely until it is manually stopped, making it perfect for tasks that need to run continuously in the background.

## Features

- **Multiple Timers**: The project demonstrates how to manage multiple timers concurrently, each running in its own thread.
- **Flexible Timer Control**: Timers can be started, paused, and stopped, giving developers control over how and when tasks are executed.
- **Thread-Safe Operation**: The timers (or **Timer Events**) are processed in *owner* thread context, ensuring thread safety.

## Project Structure

- **Timer Initialization**: The project shows how to set up different types of timers and how to associate them with specific tasks.
- **Timer Control**: Learn how to start, stop, and manage timers based on application requirements.
- **Task Execution**: Each timer is responsible for executing a task, and the project demonstrates how to handle task execution across various timer types.

## Use Cases

- **Task Scheduling**: Ideal for applications that require precise task scheduling, such as automated data collection or periodic system checks.
- **Background Tasks**: Continuous timers can be used for long-running background tasks that operate without interruption.
- **Thread-Safe Timers**: The project provides a clear example of how to implement thread-safe timers, which are essential in **multithreaded applications**.

## Conclusion

The **05_timer** project offers a practical introduction to **timer management** in **multithreaded applications** using the AREG Framework. By learning how to implement one-time, periodic, and continuous timers, developers can effectively schedule tasks and manage timers in their applications.
