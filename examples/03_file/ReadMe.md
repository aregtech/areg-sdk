# 03_file Project Overview

The **[03_file](./03_file)** project demonstrates how to work with file objects in both text and binary formats. It covers creating, copying files, and using file name masks. The example shows how to manage relative and full file paths and illustrates the use of masks like `%time%` (for timestamps) and `%appname%` (for process names) to dynamically generate file names. This project provides practical examples of file handling within the AREG SDK environment.
