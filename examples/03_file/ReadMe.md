# 03_file Project Overview

The **03_file** project demonstrates how to effectively handle **file operations** in both text and binary formats using the AREG framework. This example covers creating and copying files, managing file paths, and dynamically generating file names using masks like `%time%` for timestamps and `%appname%` for process names. It provides practical insights into file management within the AREG framework environment.

## Key Concepts

- **File Handling**: Learn how to create and manage files in text and binary formats, including copying files and working with relative and full file paths.
- **Dynamic File Naming**: Understand how to use file name masks like `%time%` (to insert timestamps) and `%appname%` (to include process names) for dynamic and flexible file naming.
- **File Paths**: Explore the difference between relative and full file paths and how to work with them in various scenarios.

## Features

- **File Creation and Copying**: This project demonstrates the basics of creating new files and copying existing ones, making it easy to manage file data in the AREG framework.
- **Text and Binary Formats**: Learn how to handle files in both text and binary formats, allowing you to work with different types of file data depending on your application's needs.
- **File Name Masks**: The use of masks like `%time%` and `%appname%` is illustrated, showing how you can generate dynamic file names based on timestamps or application-specific information.

## Project Structure

- **File Operations**: The project walks you through the process of creating, copying, and managing files in both text and binary formats.
- **Dynamic Naming**: Practical examples show how to use file name masks to automatically generate file names based on variables such as current time or process name.
- **Path Management**: The project explains how to work with both relative and absolute file paths, ensuring flexibility in different file handling scenarios.

## Use Cases

- **File Management in Applications**: Ideal for developers looking to manage files dynamically within their applications, whether for logging, data storage, or configuration purposes.
- **Text and Binary File Processing**: Learn how to process files in both formats, making this example applicable to a wide range of scenarios, including configuration management and data serialization.
- **Automated File Naming**: Useful for applications that require dynamic and automated file naming based on runtime conditions like timestamps or process names.

## Conclusion

The **03_file** project provides a comprehensive guide to handling **file operations** in the AREG SDK. With practical examples of creating, copying, and dynamically naming files, it equips developers with the knowledge to manage **file handling** efficiently in both text and binary formats.
