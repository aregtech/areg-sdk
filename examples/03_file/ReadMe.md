# 03_file Project Overview

The [03_file](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/tree/master/examples/03_file) project provides a demonstration of working with file objects. It showcases the creation of text and binary files, copying files, and the usage of masks in file names. The project explores the use of relative and full paths, and demonstrates how masks like `%time%` (time-stamp) or `%appname%` (process name) can be utilized.
