# 11_service

🧵 **Type:** Multithreading / Single Process

## Overview
The **11_service** project demonstrates how to create and manage simple **local service provider objects** within a **multithreaded application** using the AREG Framework. This example focuses on an *empty* **Local Service**, which has no data or methods and is accessible only within the local process.

## Concepts Shown
- **Local Service Provider**: Implement a service provider that operates only within the local process, without external visibility.
- **Service Registration**: Learn how to register the service in an application *model*, which loads the service at startup and unloads it when finished.
- **Multithreaded Operation**: Manage local services in a **multithreaded environment**, demonstrating parallel execution with other tasks.
- **Service Lifecycle Management**: Understand how the framework automatically handles the loading and unloading of the service.
- **Internal Process Communication**: Local service communication remains confined within the process, ensuring isolation and safety.

## How It Works
The project sets up a basic *empty* local service provider and registers it in the application *model*. The service is loaded when the application starts and unloaded when the task completes. It operates alongside other threads, showing how **multithreaded applications** can safely integrate local services. All service interactions are confined to the local process, with no external access.

## Use Cases
- Create **internal services** that communicate only within a process.
- Manage **task-specific services** with automatic lifecycle handling.
- Implement **multithreaded applications** with local service providers executing alongside other tasks.

## Takeaway
The **11_service** example illustrates how to implement **local service providers** in a **multithreaded environment**, providing a safe, isolated, and lifecycle-managed internal service.
