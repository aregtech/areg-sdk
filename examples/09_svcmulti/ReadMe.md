# 09_svcmulti Project Overview

The [09_svcmulti](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/tree/master/examples/09_svcmulti) project builds upon the concepts demonstrated in the [08_service](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/tree/master/examples/08_service) project. It showcases how to create multiple instances of the same *Service* with different names. 

In this extended version, the project utilizes empty services and creates two identical instances of a *Local Service* but with distinct names. As a result, the system contains two providers of the *Local Service*.
