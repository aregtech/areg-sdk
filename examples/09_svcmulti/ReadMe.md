# 09_svcmulti Project Overview

The **09_svcmulti** project builds on the concepts introduced in the [08_service](./../08_service) project. It shows how to create multiple instances of the same *Service* with unique names.

This project demonstrates the creation of two identical instances of a *Local Service* but with distinct names called *roles* defined in the *Application Model*. As a result, the system operates with two providers of the *Local Service* running in different threads.
