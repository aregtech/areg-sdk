# 08\_timer

🧵 **Type:** Multithreading / Single Process

## Overview

The **08\_timer** project demonstrates how to implement and manage **timers** (or *Timer Events*) in **multithreaded applications** using the AREG Framework. It shows how to initialize, execute, and terminate timers, ensuring that tasks are triggered and processed safely within their owning threads.

## Concepts Shown

* **Timer Management**: Initialize, start, pause, and stop different types of timers safely in a multithreaded context.
* **Timer Service**: Utilize the AREG *Timer Service* to handle timer events efficiently across threads.
* **Thread-Specific Timers**: Each timer executes in the context of its owning thread, ensuring thread-safe processing.
* **Timer Types**: One-time, periodic, and continuous timers illustrate different scheduling strategies.
* **Task Execution**: Timers can be linked to tasks, demonstrating controlled execution across multiple threads.

## How It Works

The project creates multiple timers within threads managed by the AREG Framework.

* **One-time Timer** executes a task once after a delay.
* **Periodic Timer** triggers a task repeatedly for a defined number of times.
* **Continuous Timer** runs indefinitely until manually stopped.

Timers are associated with tasks in their owning thread context, and the Timer Service ensures that events are triggered and handled safely and predictably.

## Use Cases

* **Task Scheduling**: Schedule one-off or repeating tasks such as data collection or monitoring routines.
* **Background Processing**: Continuous timers allow long-running tasks to operate without interruption.
* **Thread-Safe Timer Handling**: Demonstrates proper timer implementation in multithreaded applications, preventing race conditions and unsafe execution.

## Takeaway

The **08\_timer** project provides a practical introduction to **thread-safe timer management** in AREG, showing how to schedule and execute one-time, periodic, and continuous tasks within multithreaded applications.
