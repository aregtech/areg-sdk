    CONSOLE APPLICATION : 04_trace Project Overview
========================================================================

This project demonstrates use of logging (tracing). The logging requires
source code compilation with AREG_LOGS preprocessor define to
enable logging macro. It as well requires log enabling in the configuration
file (by default "./config/log.init" file). If there is no configuration file,
the logging can be forced to be enabled to apply default logging settings.

In the demo, enabling logging is forced and logging uses default settings.
