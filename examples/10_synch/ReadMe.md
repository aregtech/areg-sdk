# 10_synch

🧵 **Type:** Multithreading / Single Process

## Overview
The **10_synch** project demonstrates how to implement and manage **synchronization objects** in **multithreaded applications** using the AREG Framework. It focuses on controlling thread execution and resource access to ensure safe, coordinated operation in concurrent environments.

## Concepts Shown
- **Thread Synchronization**: Use **Mutexes** and **Synchronization Events** to control access to shared resources.
- **Synchronization Events**: Threads wait for signals before proceeding, ensuring precise coordination.
- **Single-Lock and Multi-Lock Mechanisms**: Manage either one synchronization object or multiple objects using the **Multilock** object.
- **Conditional Waiting**: Threads can wait for either one or all synchronization objects to be signaled.
- **Cross-Platform Synchronization**: Demonstrates consistent behavior across Windows and POSIX platforms using unified synchronization interfaces.

## How It Works
The example uses two threads that access shared resources under **mutex** protection. Each thread also waits on **synchronization events** signaling when it can continue or quit. The **Multilock** object allows threads to wait on multiple synchronization objects simultaneously, providing flexible control over thread execution. The project ensures that synchronization mechanisms work uniformly across platforms, abstracting platform-specific differences.

## Use Cases
- Implement **multithreaded applications** requiring precise coordination between threads.
- Ensure **cross-platform synchronization** with mutexes, events, and conditional waiting.
- Manage shared resources safely while preventing race conditions in concurrent environments.

## Takeaway
The **10_synch** example provides a clear, practical guide for **thread synchronization** in **multithreaded applications**, demonstrating mutexes, synchronization events, and conditional waiting for safe and coordinated execution.
