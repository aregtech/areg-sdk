# 02_buffer Project Overview

The **02_buffer** project demonstrates how to manage a **Shared Buffer** in a **multithreaded environment** using the AREG framework. This example focuses on initializing a shared buffer, performing read and write operations, and efficiently handling data streaming between threads. It serves as a practical introduction to managing shared resources in **multithreaded applications**.

## Key Concepts

- **Shared Buffer**: Learn how to create and manipulate a shared buffer that multiple threads can access for reading and writing data.
- **Multithreading**: Understand how to manage multiple threads that interact with a shared resource, ensuring efficient and safe access.
- **Thread Management**: The example utilizes the `Thread` class and the `IEThreadConsumer` interface for creating and managing threads, demonstrating how to coordinate thread activities.

## Features

- **Buffer Initialization**: The project shows how to initialize a **Shared Buffer** in the AREG framework, which allows data to be passed between threads.
- **Read and Write Operations**: Learn how threads can read from and write to a shared buffer without causing data corruption or race conditions.
- **Data Streaming**: This example highlights the ease of data serialization and de-serialization.

## Project Structure

- **Shared Buffer**: The core of the project revolves around the `SharedBuffer` class, which has a reference counter to disabling releasing the buffer while it is in use.
- **Thread Management**: The `Thread` class and the `IEThreadConsumer` interface are used to control the lifecycle of the threads that interact with the shared buffer.
- **Data Flow**: The project demonstrates how data can be streamed in the buffer.

## Use Cases

- **Multithreaded Applications**: Ideal for developers who need to implement **shared resource management** in multithreaded applications.
- **Inter-Thread Communication**: The project demonstrates simple way of data exchange between threads.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: This example is relevant for scenarios where data must be shared between threads.

## Conclusion

The **02_buffer** project provides a clear example of how to stream the data in a **shared resources** in a **multithreaded environment** using the AREG framework.
