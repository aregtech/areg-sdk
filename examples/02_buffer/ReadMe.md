# 02_buffer Project Overview

The **[02_buffer](./02_buffer)** project demonstrates how to use a *Shared Buffer* in a multithreaded environment. It highlights the process of initializing a shared buffer, performing read and write operations, and handling data streaming between threads. This example makes use of the `Thread`, `IEThreadConsumer`, and `SharedBuffer` classes, providing a practical introduction to managing shared resources in a multithreading context within the AREG SDK.
