# 02_buffer Project Overview

The **02_buffer** project demonstrates how to manage a **Shared Buffer** in a **multithreaded environment** with the AREG framework. This example illustrates initializing a shared buffer, performing write and read operations, and efficiently streaming data between threads. In the AREG framework, the **Shared Buffer** facilitates data transfer by creating hard copies of primitives and objects in each thread, rather than synchronizing shared memory access.

> [!NOTE]
> `SharedBuffer` is not designed for synchronized, concurrent data sharing in a multithreaded environment. Since it does not lock data access, simultaneous writes from multiple threads can yield unpredictable results. `SharedBuffer` is intended to transfer data copies from one thread to another, rather than synchronize shared data access.

## Key Concepts

- **Shared Buffer**: See how to initialize and manage a shared buffer that transfers data values from one thread to multiple others, without synchronized data locking.
- **Multithreading**: Understand the flow of primitive and object data between threads, achieving efficient data sharing without concurrent resource locking.
- **Thread Management**: Uses the `Thread` class and `IEThreadConsumer` interface to manage thread lifecycles and coordinate activities.

## Features

- **Buffer Initialization**: Learn how to initialize a **Shared Buffer** for safe data storage and transport across threads.
- **Read and Write Operations**: Explore how threads perform serialized read and write operations on the buffer, with clear data flow between threads.
- **Data Streaming**: See how data is serialized into and deserialized from the buffer, demonstrating straightforward data streaming.

## Project Structure

- **Shared Buffer**: The `SharedBuffer` class, with a reference counter, prevents buffer release while in use by multiple threads.
- **Thread Management**: The `Thread` class and `IEThreadConsumer` interface enable smooth thread creation and interaction with the shared buffer.
- **Data Flow**: Demonstrates efficient data streaming from one thread to others using the buffer.

## Use Cases

- **Multithreaded Applications**: Suitable for applications that require copying data between threads rather than synchronizing data access.
- **Inter-Thread Communication**: Facilitates straightforward data exchange between threads.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Ideal for scenarios requiring rapid, multi-threaded data distribution without shared memory conflicts.

## Conclusion

The **02_buffer** project is a practical guide to implementing inter-thread data streaming in a **multithreaded environment** with the AREG framework, emphasizing efficient data transfer without synchronization.
