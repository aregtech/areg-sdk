## Introduction

The AREG SDK provides a robust framework for building applications that require **multithreading**, **multiprocessing** (**inter-process communication or IPC**), and **real-time** event handling. This repository features a range of example projects designed to help developers quickly grasp the core functionalities of the AREG Framework, such as creating **service components**, managing **client-server interactions**, implementing **state-machines**, and developing **fault-tolerant** systems.

This guide offers a detailed overview of each example, highlighting the key features that showcase **AREG's capabilities** in building **high-performance**, **real-time**, and distributed systems.

## Quick Build Guide

Follow these steps to get started with the AREG SDK:

### 1. Clone the AREG SDK Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk.git
```

### 2. Build the AREG SDK with CMake

```bash
cmake -B ./build
cmake --build ./build -j 20
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To build the examples, ensure the CMake option `AREG_EXAMPLES` is set to `ON`. This option is **enabled** by default.
> If you want to disable the examples during the build process, set `AREG_EXAMPLES` to `OFF` using the following command:
> ```bash
> cmake -B ./build -DAREG_EXAMPLES:BOOL=OFF
> ```

For more details, refer to the [Building AREG SDK with CMake](./../docs/wiki/01b-cmake-build.md), also see the list of default CMake variable settings in the [user.cmake](./../conf/cmake/user.cmake) file.

### 3. Build with Microsoft Visual Studio

```console
MSBuild ./areg-sdk.sln
```

## AREG SDK Examples Overview

The AREG SDK includes a comprehensive set of examples that demonstrate **multithreading**, **IPC**, **service discovery**, **fault-tolerance**, and more.

### Important Notes:

- **IPC Examples**: Projects that use **inter-process communication (IPC)** require the **mcrouter** service to facilitate communication between different processes. Run **mcrouter** from the build directory for testing.
- **Fault-Tolerance**: The AREG SDK is designed with fault-tolerance in mind. The system works reliably as long as the **Service Provider**, **Service Consumer**, and **mcrouter** are running, regardless of their startup order.
- **Generated projects:** All **xx_generate** projects are generated from **Service Interface** document files (`.siml`). For CMake build these projects and source files are generated during configuration. For Microsoft Visual Studio, these projects are predefined and the sources are generated as a pre-build event of `dummy` project, which exists in this `example` directory.
- **MFC based projects:** The project [17_winchat](./17_winchat/) is build only under Windows system with Microsoft Compilers (*MSVC* and *ClangCL*) and it requires *Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC)*.
