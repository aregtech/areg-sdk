## Introduction

The **AREG SDK** is a framework for building **high-performance, real-time, and distributed applications**. It excels in:

* 🧵 **Multithreading** – Efficient handling of concurrent tasks within a single process.
* 🚀 **Multiprocessing / IPC** – Seamless inter-process communication across distributed systems.
* ⚙️ **Service Discovery & Fault-Tolerance** – Automatic service registration, recovery, and resilient operation.
* ⏱ **Event-Driven Architecture** – Real-time event handling with **timers**, **state-machines**, and **worker threads**.

This repository contains **example projects** illustrating AREG SDK capabilities. Each example provides practical insights into building scalable, robust, and efficient applications.

## Quick Start – Build & Run

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Requirements:** Ensure you have **CMake 3.20+** or **MSVS 2019+**. Ensure you have **Java17+** on your machine for code generator.

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk.git
cd areg-sdk
```

2. **Build with CMake**

```bash
cmake -B ./build
cmake --build ./build -j 20
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, `AREG_EXAMPLES` is `ON` to include examples. For advanced build options, see [Building AREG SDK with CMake](./../docs/wiki/01b-cmake-build.md).

3. **Build with Visual Studio**

```console
MSBuild ./areg-sdk.sln
```

### Developer Notes

* **IPC Projects**: Multiprocessing examples require **mtrouter** for inter-process communication.
* **Fault-Tolerance**: Services work reliably regardless of startup order due to automatic discovery and recovery.
* **Generated Projects**: Projects with names `NN_generated` are created from **Service Interface** (`.siml`) documents during build.
* **Windows-only Projects**: [20\_winchat](./20_winchat/) requires **MFC** and MSVC/ClangCL compilers.
