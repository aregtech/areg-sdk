## Introduction

This repository contains a variety of example projects designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the AREG SDK. These examples showcase core concepts such as service creation, inter-process communication (IPC), multithreading, service discovery, fault-tolerance, and more. Below is a detailed overview of each example project and its components.


## Quick Build Guide

Follow these steps to get started with AREG SDK:

### 1. Clone the AREG SDK Repository
To clone the AREG SDK repository, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk.git
```

### 2. Build the AREG SDK with CMake
To build the SDK using CMake, follow these steps:

```bash
cmake -B ./build
cmake --build ./build -j 20
```

### 3. Build with Microsoft Visual Studio
If you're using Microsoft Visual Studio, open the `areg-sdk.sln` solution file in Visual Studio and build the projects. Alternatively, you can use the command line:

```console
MSBuild ./areg-sdk.sln
```

> [!NOTE]
> To include the example projects in the build, make sure the `AREG_EXAMPLES` option is **not** set to `OFF`. If `AREG_EXAMPLES=OFF`, the examples will be excluded from the build.

For more detailed build instructions and available options, refer to the [Build Documentation](./../docs/wiki/BUILD.md).

## AREG SDK Examples Overview

The AREG SDK includes a variety of examples that showcase its features, such as multithreading, multiprocessing, synchronization, and service components.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Examples marked with **IPC** (*Inter-Process Communication*) require running the **mcrouter** to enable inter-process communication during testing. You can start **mcrouter** from the build directory as a console application.

> [!NOTE]
> The startup order of the applications does not affect system behavior. Since the **AREG Framework** supports fault tolerance, the system operates smoothly as long as the Service Provider, Service Consumer, and the Multicast Router (**mcrouter**) are running, regardless of their startup sequence.

### Available Examples:

> [!CAUTION]
> All **xx_generate** projects are generated from Service Interface document files (extension `.siml`) during CMake configuration. In case of Microsoft Visual Studio, the files of **xx_generate** are created via the script, which is triggered as a pre-build event of a `dummy` project with no functionality.
