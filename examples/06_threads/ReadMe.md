# 06_thread Project Overview

The **06_thread** project demonstrates the creation and management of custom *event dispatching* and simple threads. In this example, timers and their associated events are used as the dispatched events, showcasing how to manage threads that handle events in a multithreaded environment.

This project is useful for understanding how to create threads for event-driven processing, including the use of timers as trigger mechanisms.
