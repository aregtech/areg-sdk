# 06_file

🧵 **Type:** Multithreading / Single Process

## Overview
The **06_file** example demonstrates how to handle **file operations** in both text and binary formats using the AREG Framework.  
It covers creating, copying, and managing files, as well as dynamically generating file names with masks like `%time%` and `%appname%`.  

This example addresses common challenges in application development: managing files reliably, supporting dynamic file naming, and handling different file formats efficiently.

## Concepts Shown
- **File Handling**: Create, read, write, and copy files in text and binary formats.  
- **Dynamic File Naming**: Use masks like `%time%` and `%appname%` to generate file names automatically at runtime.  
- **File Paths**: Work with relative and absolute paths flexibly across different scenarios.

## How It Works
- The project shows **basic file operations** including creating new files, copying existing files, and writing/reading data in text or binary form.  
- **File name masks** allow dynamic naming based on timestamps or application names, which is useful for logging or temporary files.  
- Both **relative and full file paths** are handled, demonstrating how to manage file locations consistently across different environments.  
- The examples are practical and concise, allowing developers to integrate these patterns directly into their applications.

## Use Cases
- Manage **dynamic file creation** in applications for logging, data storage, or configuration.  
- Process files in **text and binary formats**, supporting versatile data handling needs.  
- Generate **automated, runtime-dependent file names**, reducing manual overhead and improving consistency.

## Takeaway
A practical guide showing how to perform **robust file operations with dynamic naming** in AREG, enabling efficient and flexible file management in both text and binary formats.
