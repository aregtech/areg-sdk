    CONSOLE APPLICATION : 10_locsvc Project Overview
========================================================================

This project demonstrates use of local service. The interface is designed
in interface describing document (HelloWorld.siml, created by design tool)
and sources are generated by code generator (see 10_generated project).

The demo creates a local service and the local client components in the
same process. The local services are not visible outside of the process
and used in multithreading communication.

The project consist of 2 sub-projects:
    1. generated  (10_generated)    -- generated code.
    2. locservice (10_locservice)   -- service provider and client.
