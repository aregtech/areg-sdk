# 16_pubfsm Project Overview

The **16_pubfsm** project showcases the AREG Framework’s ability to create a *Finite-State Machine* (**FSM**) using *Triggers*, *Timers*, and *Events*. FSM sources are generated by a code generator, and dynamic models are used to start multiple *Service Consumer* instances.

## Sub-Projects:

1. **16_generated:** Generated from [PowerManager.siml](./res/PowerManager.siml) and [TrafficController.siml](./res/TrafficController.siml) during CMake configuration or as a pre-build action in Visual Studio's `dummy` project.

2. **[16_pubclient](./pubclient/):** A *Service Consumer* that defines dynamic models during runtime, allowing multiple instances with unique names. Users can subscribe to different data updates by entering commands like `sn` (data of conventional *South-North* direction to subscribe) or `ew` (data of conventional *East-West* direction to subscribe).

3. **[16_pubservice](./pubservice/):** Creates a *Public Service* with a *Finite-State Machine* (**FSM**), allowing users to control its execution using commands like `on`, `start`, `stop`, and `off`.


Communication is facilitated by `mcrouter`, and the AREG SDK automates service discovery, ensuring fault tolerance and startup-order independence.
