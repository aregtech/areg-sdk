# 04_hellothread

🧵 **Type:** Multithreading / Single Process

## Overview
The **04_hellothread** example demonstrates the basics of **multithreading** in the AREG Framework.  
It creates a simple thread that prints "Hello World!" to the console, showing how to safely manage thread creation, execution, and lifecycle.  

This example addresses common beginner challenges in multithreaded applications: setting up threads correctly, controlling execution flow, and managing resources without errors.

## Concepts Shown
- **Thread Creation**: How to instantiate and start threads using AREG’s `Thread` class.  
- **Multithreading Basics**: Understanding independent thread execution and coordination.  
- **Thread Management with `IEThreadConsumer`**: Track thread states, control execution, and manage resources efficiently.

## How It Works
The project contains **source code** that demonstrates creating a single thread.  
- A thread is implemented via the **`Thread` class** and runs a simple task printing "Hello World!" to the console.  
- The **`IEThreadConsumer` interface** is used to manage the thread’s lifecycle, ensuring proper startup, execution, and shutdown.  
- Execution is independent of the main application flow, illustrating how multithreaded operations can run concurrently in a controlled manner.

## Use Cases
- Learn **multithreading basics** in AREG for new developers.  
- Understand how to implement **thread lifecycle management** using `IEThreadConsumer`.  
- Use as a foundation for building **more complex multithreaded applications**.

## Takeaway
A beginner-friendly example that demonstrates **safe thread creation and management** in AREG, providing a clear starting point for multithreaded development.
