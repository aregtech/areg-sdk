# 09_thread

🧵 **Type:** Multithreading / Single Process

## Overview
The **09_thread** project demonstrates how to create and manage **event-dispatching threads** (`DispatcherThread`) in the AREG Framework. This example highlights how timers can trigger tasks in **event-driven threads** within a **multithreaded environment**, showcasing the difference between standard threads and event-driven threads.

## Concepts Shown
- **Event-Dispatching Threads**: Learn how to create custom threads that handle dispatched events in your application.
- **Timer-Driven Events**: Timers act as triggers for events, demonstrating efficient handling of scheduled or delayed tasks.
- **Thread Management**: Understand how to manage multiple threads that process events safely and in parallel.
- **Custom Event Handling**: Implement event-driven architectures by processing specific events in dedicated threads.
- **Thread-Safe Event Processing**: Ensure proper handling of events in a multithreaded system without race conditions.

## How It Works
The project creates **DispatcherThread** objects that run independently and are capable of processing dispatched events. Timers are associated with these threads, triggering events at specified intervals or after delays. Each thread manages its own event queue, ensuring that events are handled in a thread-safe and efficient manner. Developers can extend this pattern to build complex **event-driven architectures** using multiple threads and timer-triggered events.

## Use Cases
- Implement **event-driven architectures** where tasks are triggered by timers or other events.
- Learn **multithreaded event processing** for applications requiring parallel handling of asynchronous events.
- Demonstrate **timer-triggered event workflows**, useful for scheduling, monitoring, or periodic task execution.

## Takeaway
The **09_thread** example provides a practical guide for creating **custom, event-driven threads** with **timer-based triggers** in a **multithreaded environment** using the AREG Framework.
