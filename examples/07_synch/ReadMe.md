# 07_synch Project Overview

The **07_synch** project demonstrates how to implement and manage **synchronization objects** in multithreaded applications using the AREG Framework. It focuses on controlling thread execution and resource access to ensure smooth and efficient operation in concurrent environments.

## Key Features

- **Thread Synchronization**: Manage thread synchronization with **Mutexes** and **Synchronization Events** to control access to shared resources in a **Multithreading** environment.
- **Synchronization Events**: These events allow threads to wait for specific signals (similar to **POSIX signals** or **conditional variables**) before proceeding, ensuring precise control over thread execution.
- **Single-lock and Multi-lock Mechanisms**: The example showcases both **single-lock** (locking one synchronization object) and **multi-lock** (waiting for multiple synchronization objects) techniques to coordinate threads.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Although **synchronization events** are common in Windows, this example demonstrates how they can be adapted for non-Windows platforms (e.g., using POSIX **signals** or **condition variables**) without changing behavior across platforms.

## Key Concepts

1. **Mutex**: A locking mechanism that ensures only one thread can access shared resources at a time, preventing race conditions.
2. **Synchronization Event**: A signaling mechanism that makes threads wait until a **signal** is received, offering fine-grained control over thread execution. Each thread can have its own event signal to indicate when to quit.
3. **Conditional Waiting**: Threads can wait on multiple synchronization objects (for example, mixed mutexes and events) using the **Multilock** object, which allows waiting for either one object to be signaled or all objects to be signaled.
4. **Multithreading**: The project explores advanced multithreading techniques, providing solutions for coordinating concurrent threads and ensuring safe access to shared data.

## Project Structure

- **Thread Creation**: The project uses two simple threads that need to access a shared resource. Each thread performs tasks and waits for signals.
- **Mutex**: Two **mutexes** are used in the project, either in a locked or unlocked state, to manage exclusive access to resources.
- **Synchronization Events**: There are two global synchronization events, plus individual events for each thread. These events signal when the threads should proceed or exit.
- **Multilock Object**: A key feature of the example is the **Multilock** object, which coordinates the waiting on multiple synchronization objects (both mutexes and events). It waits for either one object to be signaled or all of them, offering flexibility in managing thread execution.
- **Cross-Platform Synchronization**: Although synchronization objects like events are handled differently in POSIX and Windows, the AREG Framework provides a unified interface, ensuring consistent behavior across platforms.

## Use Cases

- **Multithreaded Applications**: Ideal for developers building **multithreaded applications** that require precise coordination between threads using synchronization objects.
- **Cross-Platform Synchronization**: The example highlights how to adapt Windows-centric synchronization mechanisms (such as events) for non-Windows platforms using **POSIX signals** or **conditional variables**, ensuring seamless cross-platform operation.

## Conclusion

The **07_synch** project is a comprehensive example of using the AREG SDK to implement **thread synchronization** through **mutexes**, **synchronization events**, and **conditional waiting**. By exploring both single and multi-lock mechanisms, this example provides practical, adaptable solutions for managing thread execution and shared resource access in **multithreaded** and **cross-platform** applications. This project is especially useful for developers looking to implement reliable, efficient synchronization in their applications.
