# 07_synch Project Overview

The [07_synch](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/tree/master/examples/07_synch) project provides a demonstration of using synchronization objects for achieving thread synchronization. It showcases various synchronization objects such as mutex and synchronization events, and how they can be combined to create complex synchronization scenarios.

In particular, the project showcases the use of synchronization events, which are powerful objects similar to POSIX signals or conditional variables. These events allow threads to wait for specific conditions to be signaled. Although synchronization events are not part of the POSIX standard and are primarily used in Windows, they offer great flexibility and utility in thread synchronization.
