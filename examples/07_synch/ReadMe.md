# 07_synch Project Overview

The **[07_synch](./examples/07_synch)** project demonstrates how to use synchronization objects to manage thread synchronization in multithreaded applications. It covers key synchronization mechanisms like mutexes and synchronization events, showing how they can be combined to handle complex synchronization scenarios.

In particular, the project highlights the use of *synchronization events*, which are powerful tools similar to POSIX signals or condition variables. These events allow threads to wait for specific conditions to be signaled. While not part of the POSIX standard and primarily used in Windows environments, synchronization events offer great flexibility and can greatly enhance thread coordination.
