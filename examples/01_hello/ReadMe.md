# 01_hello Project Overview

The **01_hello** project is a simple yet powerful example that demonstrates the basics of **multithreading** using the AREG Framework. This project shows how to create and manage a thread to print the classic "Hello World!" message to the console, providing a clear introduction to thread handling in the framework.

## Key Concepts

- **Thread Creation**: Learn how to create and manage threads using the AREG Framework's `Thread` class.
- **Multithreading Basics**: Understand how threads work and how to implement basic thread behavior in a **multithreaded application**.
- **Thread Management**: The example showcases the use of the `IEThreadConsumer` interface to control thread execution and states, and ensure efficient resource handling.

## Features

- **Simple Thread Execution**: The project creates a thread that prints "Hello World!" to the console, making it an excellent starting point for understanding how threading works within the AREG framework.
- **Introduction to `IEThreadConsumer`**: This interface is used to track thread states and manage thread lifecycle, ensuring proper execution flow and coordination within the framework.

## Project Structure

- **Source Code**: The code is designed to be easily understandable, showcasing how to set up a basic thread that runs independently of the main application flow.
- **Thread Class**: The `Thread` class from the AREG framework is used to handle thread creation and management, giving developers a solid understanding of how to work with threading mechanisms in the framework.

## Use Cases

- **Multithreading Basics**: Ideal for developers new to the AREG framework who want to grasp the essentials of thread creation and execution.
- **Thread Lifecycle Management**: Learn how to implement the `IEThreadConsumer` interface to control thread behavior efficiently.

## Conclusion

The **01_hello** project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to **multithreading** in the AREG framework.
