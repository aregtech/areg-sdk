```
The classes defined inside each subdirectory of `framework/areg` folder can be used to develop an application, but the classes declared in `private` subdirectory inside each of them are designed for internal use and should not be used by developers.

After compiling using _CMake_, _Make_ or _MS Visual Studio_, the root folder _areg-sdk_ will contain a recoverable _product_ subfolder that contains build binaries.

## The structure of _the document folder_:

```
docs
  |
  +- /img ......... --> Folder of images used in documents.
  |
  +- DEVELOP.md ... --> The developer guide and technical explanations.
  |
  +- HOWTO.md ..... --> The instructions how to build software.
  |
  +- README.md .... --> This document file.
  |
  +- POSIX.md  .... --> The instructions to compile applications in Linux.
  |
  +- WIN32.md  .... --> The instructions to compile applications in Windows.
```
