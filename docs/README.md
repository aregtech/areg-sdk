Classes defined within each subdirectory of the `framework/areg` folder can be used to develop applications. However, classes declared in the `private` subdirectory of each of them are intended for internal use and should not be used by developers.

After compiling using CMake, Make, or MS Visual Studio, the root folder `areg-sdk` will contain a recoverable `product` subdirectory that contains the built binaries.

> [!TIP]
> Visit [AREG SDK Wiki](./wiki/README.md) page for details of available documentation, which is periodically updating. Any help to improve the Wiki pages are appreciated very much.
