  <br /><br /><strong>AREG SDK Technical Guidance</strong>
</h1>

[**AREG (Automated Real-time Event Grid) Framework**](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk) is a cutting-edge interface-centric solution designed to facilitate real-time asynchronous communication in distributed and mist-computing environments. The communication engine powering the AREG Software Development Kit (SDK) supports **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**, it is built upon the **Object Remote Procedure Call (Object RPC)** protocol, helping developers create scalable, multitasking applications across multiple platforms. At the heart of the AREG SDK lies the AREG Framework written in C++, which comprises various software components and tools to simplify the development of distributed, real-time, and asynchronous applications. This framework enables connected Things to interact and offer services, functioning like lightweight distributed micro-servers.

These pages serve as comprehensive resources, providing detailed descriptions of the AREG SDK framework, along with practical examples and a range of accompanying tools.
