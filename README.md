## Motivation[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#motivation)

Traditionally, devices act as connected clients to stream data to the cloud or fog servers for further processing.

<div align="center"><a href="https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/docs/img/mist-network.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/mist-network.png" alt="Diagram showing IoT-to-Cloud (Nebula) network connections" style="width:70%;height:70%"/></a></div>

As data is generated and collected at the edge of the network (**mist network**), there is a growing need to redefine the role of connected Things and enable network-accessible _Public Services_ on the edge device, thereby extending the _Cloud_ capabilities to the extreme edge. This approach provides a robust foundation for solutions like:
* **Enhancing data privacy**, which is crucial for sensitive information.
* **Decrease data streaming**, which is a fundamental condition to optimize network communication.
* **Autonomous, intelligent and self-aware devices** with services directly in the environment of data origin.

<div align="right"><kbd><a href="#table-of-contents">↑ Back to top ↑</a></kbd></div>

---

## Interface-centricity[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#interface-centricity)

At the core of AREG is **ORPC** (_Object Remote Procedure Call_), which targets interfaces on objects. This allows AREG to establish a **service mesh** or **service grid** where applications expose reusable services. Clients, without knowledge of the server’s network location, can request services seamlessly via method invocation.

<div align="center"><a href="https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/docs/img/interface-centric.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/interface-centric.png" alt="Diagram showing multiprocess communication" style="width:50%;height:50%"/></a></div>

This **interface-driven Object RPC** model mirrors object-oriented programming principles and is flexible in managing multiple object instances. It imposes no protocol limitations and supports bi-directional communication to ensure seamless messaging between connected software nodes. In this model:
* **Service Providers** (*micro-server objects*) offer reusable, accessible services.
* **Service Consumers** (*client objects*) invoke services without needing to know the network details.

AREG’s design integrates **Client-Server (Request-Reply)** and **Publish-Subscribe (PubSub)** models, enabling it to support both action- and data-centric communication.

<div align="right"><kbd><a href="#table-of-contents">↑ Back to top ↑</a></kbd></div>

---

## More than Embedded[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#more-than-embedded)

The architecture of AREG is ideal for embedded applications, but its capabilities extend far beyond. AREG offers distributed and scalable solutions for **multithreading**, **multiprocessing**, and **internet**  communications, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications. Services in AREG are categorized into three types: **Local**, **Public**, and **Internet**, enabling flexible and efficient remote communication across diverse environments.

<div align="center"><a href="https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/docs/img/areg-services.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/areg-services.png" alt="Diagram showing Services and AREG Framework message handling" style="width:70%;height:70%"/></a></div>

> [!NOTE]
> AREG currently supports **Local** (multithreading) and **Public** (multiprocessing) services.

The fault-tolerant design of AREG offers key advantages, such as:
* **Resilience:** Failure in one application does not affect the overall system.
* **Automatic Discovery:** Services are automatically discovered by clients without manual configuration.
* **Thread-Safe Execution:** All service methods are executed within their respective thread contexts, ensuring thread safety and independence.

## Integration and Development[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#integration-and-development)

For a practical example of building real-time, distributed systems using **AREG SDK**, check out the **[AREG SDK Demo](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk-demo)** project, which includes implementations of multitasking applications for **embedded, IoT mist- and fog-systems**.

### AREG SDK Integration Methods

There are three ways to integrate the AREG SDK into your project:

#### 1. Integrate by Fetching sources

Add the following script to your `CMakeLists.txt` to integrate AREG SDK:

```cmake
find_package(areg CONFIG)
if (NOT areg_FOUND)
    include(FetchContent)
    FetchContent_Declare(
        areg-sdk
        GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk.git
        GIT_TAG "master"
    )
    FetchContent_MakeAvailable(areg-sdk)
    set(AREG_SDK_ROOT "${areg-sdk_SOURCE_DIR}")
    include_directories("${AREG_SDK_ROOT}/framework")
endif()

include("${AREG_SDK_ROOT}/areg.cmake")
```

This either finds or fetches the AREG SDK components from `master` branch. See the **[CMake Integration Guide](./docs/wiki/cmake-integrate.md)** for more details.

#### 2. Integrate as a project submodule

1. Add `areg-sdk` as a **Git submodule** in your project.
2. Include the `*.vcxproj` files from `<areg-sdk>/framework` in your solution.
3. Link your project with the `areg` library and set project dependencies.

For full details, see the **[Visual Studio Integration Guide](./docs/wiki/MSVS-INTEGRATE.md)**.

#### 3. Integrate the `areg` Package (vcpkg)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting with AREG SDK 2.0, you can integrate it using the `vcpkg` package manager.

Before starting, visit the **[official vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)** repository to clone and install the `vcpkg` package manager tool in your PC.

1. **Install and integrate the `areg` package:** Example of the AREG SDK components, headers and its dependencies installation under Linux:  
   ```bash
   ./vcpkg install areg:linux-64
   ./vcpkg integrate install
   ```

2. **Integrate with CMake:** Add the following script to your `CMakeLists.txt` (replace `<example>` with real target):
   ```cmake
   find_package(areg CONFIG REQUIRED)
   target_link_libraries(<example> PRIVATE areg::areg)
   ```
   Use `vcpkg` toolchain file (`<vcpkg-root>` is the root path of `vcpkg`) to configure and build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake -B ./build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg-root>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
   cmake --build ./build -j 20
   ```

3. **Integrate with Microsoft Visual Studio:** In Microsoft Visual Studio, there is no need to add AREG SDK projects in the solution file. Develop projects and make sure to link `areg` library with binaries either in *Project Properties* or by adding this line of code:
   ```cpp
   #pragma comment(lib, "areg")
   ```

For details of installing and using `areg` package, see the appropriate **[integrate `areg` package](./docs/wiki/AREG-PACKAGE.md)** document.

### Service Creation and Development

Follow the **[“Hello Service!”](./docs/HelloService.md)** tutorial for step-by-step instructions. Generated service interface files integrate with CMake or Visual Studio projects. Service Providers extend **xxxStub**, and Service Consumers extend **xxxClientBase**.

### Example: Application Model Setup

When developing **Service Provider** and **Service Consumer** components, developers can easily determine whether to run components in the same process (multithreading) or in separate processes (multiprocessing) for optimal performance in real-time applications by defining the **Application Model**. Below is an example of setting up a *model* where the *Service Provider* and *Service Consumer* components run in the same process, but on different threads.

```cpp
BEGIN_MODEL("ApplicationModel")
    // Provider Thread
    BEGIN_REGISTER_THREAD("ProviderThread", NECommon::WATCHDOG_IGNORE)
        BEGIN_REGISTER_COMPONENT("ServiceProvider", ServiceComponent)
            REGISTER_IMPLEMENT_SERVICE(NEHelloService::ServiceName, NEHelloService::InterfaceVersion)
        END_REGISTER_COMPONENT("ServiceProvider")
    END_REGISTER_THREAD("ProviderThread")
        
    // Consumer Thread
    BEGIN_REGISTER_THREAD("ConsumerThread", NECommon::WATCHDOG_IGNORE)
        BEGIN_REGISTER_COMPONENT("ServiceConsumer", ClientComponent)
            REGISTER_DEPENDENCY("ServiceProvider")
        END_REGISTER_COMPONENT("ServiceConsumer")
    END_REGISTER_THREAD("ConsumerThread")
END_MODEL("ApplicationModel")

int main(void)
{
    Application::initApplication();
    Application::loadModel("ApplicationModel");
    Application::waitAppQuit();
    Application::unloadModel("ApplicationModel");
    Application::releaseApplication();
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- **ServiceProvider** runs on `ProviderThread`, and **ServiceConsumer** runs on `ConsumerThread`.
- `REGISTER_DEPENDENCY("ServiceProvider")` means `ServiceConsumer` component consumes the services provided by `ServiceProvider`.

You can also set up multiprocess applications using same components and changing *model*. As a practical example, follow projects in the **[00_helloservice](./examples/00_helloservice/)** directory.

> [!TIP]
> *Learn how AREG SDK simplifies the creation of Service Providers and Consumers, supporting both multithreading and multiprocessing for real-time, distributed applications.* Visit **[examples](./examples/README.md)** to see the list of demonstrated applications and features of the AREG communication engine.

### Multicast Router and Log Collector

Both **mcrouter** and **logger** are essential components for communication and log collection. Configuration templates for the multicast router and log collector services are provided in the `areg.init` file. Both processes are designed to run as console applications or as **Operating System managed** services.

For in-depth details of building and using these applications, review the descriptions in **[Multicast Router Service](./docs/wiki/MCROUTER.md)** and **[Log Collector Service](./docs/wiki/LOGGER.md)** pages. *Discover how the AREG SDK’s Multicast Router and Log Collector streamline communication and logging in edge computing and real-time data transfer systems.*
