## Introduction[![](./docs/img/pin.svg)](#introduction)

**AREG SDK** is a developer-friendly, interface-centric real-time asynchronous communication engine to enable [distributed-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) and [mist-](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/500-325/final)computing, where connected Things interact and provide services as if they act like thin distributed servers.

## Motivation[![](./docs/img/pin.svg)](#motivation)

Traditionally, devices are connected to clients to stream data to the cloud or fog servers for further processing.
<br /><br /><a href="/docs/img/mist-network.png"><img src="/docs/img/mist-network.png" alt="IoT-to-Cloud (Nebula) network" style="width:70%;height:70%"/></a><br /><br />
Since data is generated and collected at the edge of the network (mist network), it makes sense to change the role of connected Things and provide network-accessible (_Public_) services directly on devices. This extends _Cloud_ to the extreme edge and it is a good foothold for robust solutions such as:
* _Increase data privacy_, which is an important factor for sensitive data.
* _Decrease data streaming_, which is a fundamental condition to optimize network communication.
* Develop _autonomous, intelligent and self-aware devices_ by providing network services directly in the environment of data origin.

## More than embedded[![](./docs/img/pin.svg)](#more-than-embedded)

When we were designing AREG SDK, the guiding principle was to provide a homogeneous solution for Multithreading, Multiprocessing and Internet communication wrapped in services appropriately having _Local_, _Public_ and _Internet_ categories. These services are neither processes nor tasks managed by the operating system, they are software components with a predefined interface, in which methods are invoked remotely.
<br /><a href="docs/img/areg-services.png"><img src="docs/img/areg-services.png" alt="AREG SDK distributed services" style="width:70%;height:70%"/></a><br />
> ðŸ’¡ In current version, the AREG engine handles multithreading (_Local_) and multiprocessing (_Public_) communication. 

The AREG engine forms a fault-tolerant system, automatically discovers services, automates communication, simplifies distributed programming, and helps developers to focus on application business logic as if they would program a single process application with one thread where methods of objects are event-driven. The engine guarantees that:
* The crash of one application does not cause the crash of the system.
* The service clients are automatically notified about service availability status.
* The client requests are automatically invoked to run on the service component.
* The service responses are automatically invoked on the exact client, and they are not mixed or missed.
* The subscriptions on data, responses and broadcasts are automatically invoked on the client when service triggers a call.

## Flexible and self-sufficient[![](./docs/img/pin.svg)](#flexible-and-self-sufficient)

_AREG SDK_ is ideal to develop _multiprocessing_ and _multithreading_ **Desktop** and/or **Embedded** applications. The _interface-centric_ solution of AREG framework includes all features of _action-centric_ (Request-Reply) and _data-centric_ (Publisher-Subscriber) solutions:
* The request and response mechanisms are as simple as calling an ordinary method of an object.
* The subscriptions are dynamic and the latest data is delivered immediately after subscribing.
* Clients may subscribe and unsubscribe on data and events at any time during runtime.

The framework ensures to keep applications modular, where components communicate via predefined _Service Interfaces_, which are invoked in the thread-safe environment. It easily handles cross-dependencies, where applications do not need to have special startup sequences and priorities.

> ðŸ’¡ The [examples](./examples) of _AREG SDK_ contain multiple projects to check the features and fault tolerant behavior of AREG communication engine.

## Composition[![](./docs/img/pin.svg)](#composition)

AREG SDK consists of:
1. [Multicast router (_mcrouter_)](./framework/mcrouter/) to use for IPC. It runs either as a service managed by the OS or as a console application.
2. [AREG framework (or engine)](./framework/areg/) is a library (shared or static) linked in every application.
3. [Code generator tool](./tools/) to create client and server base objects from a service prototype document.

The framework contains a dynamic and configurable logging service. More tools and features are planned for future releases.

## Software build[![](./docs/img/pin.svg)](#software-build)

An example to get source codes and compile under **Linux**. You'd need at least C++17 `g++` (default) compiler. Open _Terminal_ console in your `projects` folder and take the following steps:

_To build the project using `cmake`_
```bash
# Step 1: Get sources from GitHub
$ git clone https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk.git
$ cd areg-sdk

# Step 2: Create a subdirectory for CMake cache files and change directory to it.
$ mkdir build && cd build

# Step 3: Initialize CMake cache and build systems configuration.
#         Enable examples compilation by using BUILD_EXAMPLES flag.
$ cmake .. -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON

# Step 4: Compile sources by calling: cmake --build [CMake cache dir] <optional> -j [concurrent jobs]
$ cmake --build . -j 8
 ```

_To build the project using `make`_
```bash
# Step 1: Get sources from GitHub
$ git clone https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk.git
$ cd areg-sdk

# Step 2: Compile sources from terminal by calling: make [all] [framework] [examples]
$ make
```

After compilation, the binaries are located in `<areg-sdk>/product/build/<compiler-platform-path>/bin` folder.

_AREG SDK sources are developed for:_

_Compile AREG SDK sources and examples:_
| Solution | Platforms | API | Quick actions to compile |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CMakeLists.txt` | **Linux, Windows** | _POSIX_, _Win32_ | It is used to compile applications using following tools:<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; - call `cmake` in _command line_;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; - configure and build in _Visual Studio Code_ IDE;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; - build in _Microsoft Visual Studio_ IDE (VS2019 and higher). |
| `Makefile` | **Linux**| _POSIX_ | It is used to compile application by calling `make` in _command line_. |

| `.project` | **Linux, Windows** | _POSIX_ | To import and build projects in _Eclipes_ IDE. |

> ðŸ’¡ Compilation with _Eclipse_ under **Windows** platform might require to switch the Toolchain. For example, `Cygwin GCC`.<br />
> ðŸ’¡ For **Linux** platform the default compiler is `g++`. To change the compiler to build with:<br />
> - `cmake`, update [conf/cmake/pre-project.cmake](./conf/cmake/pre-project.cmake) file. For example, `set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER /usr/bin/g++-4.2)`<br />
> - `make`, update [conf/make/user.mk](./conf/make/user.mk) file. For example, `Toolset := clang++-13`.

Details on how to change compiler, load and compile sources for various targets are described in [HOWTO](./docs/HOWTO.md).

## Software integration[![](./docs/img/pin.svg)](#software-integration)

#### Multicast router

Configure [_router.init_](./framework/areg/resources/router.init) file to set the IP-address and the port of _multicast router_:
```
connection.address.tcpip    = 127.0.0.1	# the address of mcrouter host
connection.port.tcpip       = 8181      # the connection port of mcrouter
```
The multicast router forms the network and can run on any device. For example, in case of M2M communication, it can run on a gateway, in case of IPC, it can run on the same machine. In case of multithreading application development, there is no need to configure `router.init` and run _mcrouter_.

#### Logging service

Configure [_log.init_](./framework/areg/resources/log.init) to set scopes, log priorities and log file name:
```
log.file        = %home%/logs/%appname%_%time%.log # create logs in 'log' subfolder of user home 
scope.mcrouter.*= NOTSET ;                         # disable logs for mcrouter.

scope.my_app.*                   = DEBUG | SCOPE ; # enable all logs of my_app
scope.my_app.ignore_this_scope   = NOTSET ;        # disable logs of certain scopes in my_app
scope.my_app.ignore_this_group_* = NOTSET ;        # disable logs of certain scope group in my_app
```
> ðŸ’¡ By default, the `router.init` and `log.init` files are located in the `config` subfolder of binaries.<br />
> ðŸ’¡ To enable all logs of all applications, use `scope.*  = DEBUG | SCOPE ;` .<br />
> ðŸ’¡ In the current version the logging is possible only in file.

### Development

The development guidance and step-by-step example to create a simple service-enabled application are described in [DEVELOP](./docs/DEVELOP.md).

## Use cases and benefits[![](./docs/img/pin.svg)](#use-cases-and-benefits)

AREG SDK can be used in a very large scope of multithreading and multiprocessing application development running on Linux or Windows machines.

#### Distributed solution

AREG SDK is a distributed computing solution, where the services can be distributed and run on any node of the network. The automatic service discovery makes service location transparent, so that the applications interact as if the components are located in one process. Developers define a _model_, which is a description of service relationship, and load it to start services during runtime. The services can easily be distributed between multiple processes.

The following is a demonstration of a static _model_ description, which is loaded to start services and unloaded to stop them.
```cpp
// main.cpp source file.

// Defines static model with 2 services
BEGIN_MODEL(NECommon::ModelName)

    BEGIN_REGISTER_THREAD( "Thread1" )
        BEGIN_REGISTER_COMPONENT( "RemoteRegistry", RemoteRegistryService )
            REGISTER_IMPLEMENT_SERVICE( NERemoteRegistry::ServiceName, NERemoteRegistry::InterfaceVersion )
        END_REGISTER_COMPONENT( "RemoteRegistry" )
    END_REGISTER_THREAD( "Thread1" )

    BEGIN_REGISTER_THREAD( "Thread2" )
        BEGIN_REGISTER_COMPONENT( "SystemShutdown", SystemShutdownService )
            REGISTER_IMPLEMENT_SERVICE( NESystemShutdown::ServiceName, NESystemShutdown::InterfaceVersion )
        END_REGISTER_COMPONENT( "SystemShutdown" )
    END_REGISTER_THREAD( "Thread2" )

END_MODEL(NECommon::ModelName)

// the main function
int main()
{
    // Initialize application, enable logging, servicing, routing, timer and watchdog.
    // Use default settings.
    Application::initApplication( );

    // load model to start service components
    Application::loadModel(NECommon::ModelName);

    // wait until Application quit signal is set.
    Application::waitAppQuit(NECommon::WAIT_INFINITE);

    // stop and unload service components
    Application::unloadModel(NECommon::ModelName);

    // release and cleanup resources of application.
    Application::releaseApplication();

    return 0;
}
```
In the example, the `"RemoveRegistry"` and the `"SystemShudown"` are the names of components called _roles_, and the `NERemoteRegistry::ServiceName` and the `NESystemShutdown::ServiceName` are the _interface names_. In combination, they define the _service name_ used to access in the network. These MACRO create static _model_ `NECommon::ModelName`, which is loaded when call `Application::loadModel(NECommon::ModelName)`, and the services are stopped when call `Application::unloadModel(NECommon::ModelName)`.

In this example, services can be merged in one thread or distributed in 2 processes by defining a _model_ in each process. Independent on service location, neither software developers, nor service client objects feel a difference except for possible slight network latency when running IPC. The services must have unique names within the scope of visibility. Means, in case of _Public_ services, the names are unique within a network, and in case of _Local_ services, the names are unique within a process scope. An example of developing a service and a client in one and multiple processes is in [**Hello Service!**](./docs/DEVELOP.md#hello-service) project described in the development guide.

#### Driverless devices

Normally, the devices are supplied with the drivers to install in the system and with the header files to integrate in the application(s). The drivers often run in Kernel mode and the crash of the driver crashes the entire system. Driver development requires a special technique, which is different for each operating system, and it is hard to debug. 
<br /><a href="/docs/img/driver-solution.png"><img src="/docs/img/driver-solution.png" alt="Kkernel-mode driver solution" style="width:70%;height:70%"/></a><br />
Our proposal is to deliver driverless service-enabled devices, where device-specific services are described in the interface prototype documents. 
<br /><a href="/docs/img/driverless-solution.png"><img src="/docs/img/driverless-solution.png" alt="AREG SDK driverless solution" style="width:70%;height:70%"/></a><br />
In contrast to drivers, the service development does not differ from user mode application development, it is faster to develop, easily serves multiple applications (service clients), contains fewer risks and requires less development resources. The client object generated from the supplied service interface prototype document is easily integrated into the application to communicate and trigger device-specific service(s).

#### Real-time solutions

When a remote method of the service interface is called, the engine of AREG SDK immediately generates and delivers messages to the target component, which invokes appropriate methods of addressed service. This makes communication real-time with ultra-low networking latency. Such solutions are highly required to develop time-sensitive applications for automotive, flock of drones, medtech, real-time manufacturing, real-time monitoring and other projects.
<br /><a href="/docs/img/areg-sdk-features.png"><img src="/docs/img/areg-sdk-features.png" alt="AREG SDK and multicast features" style="width:70%;height:70%"/></a><br />

#### Digital twin

Often, the digital twin applications use client-server architecture, where the middleware server collects the data of external devices and the UI application virtualizes them. In such solutions, devices interact either through server or UI client applications. The event-driven and the service-oriented architecture, and the real-time communication of AREG SDK is a perfect solution to develop digital twin applications that virtualize, monitor and control external devices, and immediately react to environment or device state change in real-time mode. External devices may also communicate without additional layers, which is an important factor for emergency, security and safety cases.

#### Simulation and test automations

When hardware provisioning to all employees is impossible, testing and checking unexpected phenomena of rapidly changing software in a simulated environment can be the most rational solution. If unit tests are used by developers to test a small portion of code and they may contain bugs, the simulation is used by developers and testers to check the system's functionality and stability. Simulations are portable and accessible to everyone, help to optimize solutions and avoid unnecessary risks. Projects using simulations are better prepared for remote work and easier to outsource.
<br /><a href="/docs/img/software-layers.png"><img src="/docs/img/software-layers.png" alt="Software application 4 layers" style="width:70%;height:70%"/></a><br />
The software components in applications normally are split into Data, Controller, Business and the optional Presentation layers. Distributed and service-oriented solution of the AREG engine eases system testing in a simulated environment, where the Simulation application provides an implementation of Data layer services, so that the rest of the application can be tested without any change.

The same technique of simulating data can be used to create API-driven test automations.
