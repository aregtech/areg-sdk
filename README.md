## Introduction[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#introduction)

**AREG** (*Automated Real-time Event Grid*) is a communication engine that enables data transmission in IoT [fog- and mist-network](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/500-325/final). It is lightweight, automated, featured, and works on different platforms. AREG uses an interface-centric approach to create a grid of services that allows multiple devices and software nodes to operate like distributed servers and clients. By automating real-time data transmission, and using both Client-Server and Publish-Subscribe models, AREG ensures reliable and efficient communication between connected software nodes.

## Motivation[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#motivation)

Traditionally, devices act as connected clients to stream data to the cloud or fog servers for further processing.

<div align="center"><a href="https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/docs/img/mist-network.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/mist-network.png" alt="IoT-to-Cloud (Nebula) network" style="width:70%;height:70%"/></a></div>

As data is generated and collected at the edge of the network (**mist network**), it is logical to redefine the role of connected Things and enable network-accessible services (_Public Services_) on them, thereby extending the _Cloud_ to the extreme edge. This approach serves as a strong foundation for implementing robust solutions such as:
* _Increase data privacy_, which is an important factor for sensitive data.
* _Decrease data streaming_, which is a fundamental condition to optimize network communication.
* _Autonomous, intelligent and self-aware devices_ with services directly in the environment of data origin.

## Interface-centricity[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#interface-centricity)

**ORPC**, or _Object Remote Procedure Call_, is a remote procedure call concept that targets an interface on an object. It enables the construction of a _service mesh_ (or _service grid_), where applications offer reusable services, and programmable client objects request method execution of programmable server objects without needing to know their location in the network.

<div align="center"><a href="https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/docs/img/interface-centric.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/interface-centric.png" alt="Service oriented and interface-centric" style="width:50%;height:50%"/></a></div>

The ORPC concept is interface-centric, similar to object-oriented programming, and supports transparent handling of multiple instances of the same object. There are no protocol restrictions, although the bi-directional communication is necessary to send messages to all connected nodes. The programmable server objects are called *Service Providers*, and the programmable clients are called *Service Consumers*. This approach enables AREG to combine the features of _action-centric_ (Client-Server / Request-Reply) and _data-centric_ (Publish-Subscribe / PubSub) models.

<div align="right">[ <a href="#table-of-contents">â†‘ Back to top â†‘</a> ]</div>

---

## More than embedded[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#more-than-embedded)

The *interface-centric* nature of AREG engine provides a distributed solution for embedded application. AREG is designed to provide a homogeneous solution for multithreading, multiprocessing, and internet communications through categorized services (_Local_, _Public_, and _Internet_). These services are software components with predefined interfaces, which methods are invoked remotely.

<div align="center"><a href="https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/docs/img/areg-services.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/areg-services.png" alt="AREG SDK distributed services" style="width:70%;height:70%"/></a></div>

> ðŸ’¡ Currently AREG engine supports _Local_ (multithreading) and _Public_ (multiprocessing) service categories.

AREG forms a fault-tolerant system that automatically discovers and automates communications between services, allowing developers to focus on application logic development. The system ensures:
* The crash of one application does not affect the entire system.
* The clients automatically receive service availability notifications.
* The requests, responses, and notifications are invoked in their own thread context.

<div align="right">[ <a href="#table-of-contents">â†‘ Back to top â†‘</a> ]</div>

---

## Composition[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#composition)

At present, the Automated Real-time Event Grid software development kit (**AREG SDK**) comprises the following primary modules:
- [Multicast router (_mcrouter_)](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/tree/master/framework/mcrouter/): a console application or OS-managed service that facilitates the message routing.
- The [AREG engine](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/tree/master/framework/areg/): a framework library that enables communication between software components.
- [Code generator](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/tree/master/tools/): a tool to generate service _Provider_ and _Consumer_ objects from interface documents.

Furthermore, the AREG SDK includes a variety of [examples](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/tree/master/examples/), which illustrate the robust characteristics and functionality of the AREG communication engine. Additionally, there are various [user interface (UI) tools](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk-tools/) currently in the development stage that aim to simplify and expedite the process of designing services and applications, as well as analyzing and interacting with applications on remote machines.

---

## Clone sources[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#clone-sources)

To obtain the AREG SDK source codes and the dependent modules, run the git-command in your `projects` folder:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk.git
```

Alternatively, to clone only the submodule sources, run the git-command in the AREG SDK root folder:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To update the AREG SDK to the latest submodule sources, use the git-command:
```bash
git submodule update --remote --recursive
```

> ðŸ’¡ Please note that after running this git-command, your submodule sources may differ from the sources that AREG SDK uses.

<div align="right">[ <a href="#table-of-contents">â†‘ Back to top â†‘</a> ]</div>

## Quick build[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#quick-build)

The source codes of the AREG SDK are implemented using **C++17** and can be compiled on multiple platforms, CPUs, and compilers.
- **Supported compilers:** GCC, Clang, Cygwin GCC, and MSVC. 
- **Supported platforms:** Windows, Linux, and macOS. 
- **Supported CPU:** x86, x86_64, arm, and aarch64. 

To compile the sources, the following tools can be used:

| Tool | Solution | Platforms | API | Quick actions to compile |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cmake` | `CMakeLists.txt` | Linux, Cygwin, Windows | POSIX, Win32 | - Build with *cmake*.<br/> - Build in *VSCode*.<br/> - Build in *MSVS*. |
| `make` | `Makefile` | Linux, Cygwin | POSIX | - Build with *make*. |
| `msbuild` | `areg-sdk.sln` | Windows | Win32 | - Build with *msbuild*.<br/> - Open and build in *MSVS*. |

After compilation, the binaries are stored in the `<areg-sdk>/product/build/<family>-<compiler>/<platform>-<bitness>-<cpu>-<build type>/bin` folder. For example, if the code is compiled with GNU GCC on a 64-bit Linux system with an x86_64 CPU and in release mode, the binaries will be in the `./product/build/gnu-gcc/linux-64-x86_64-release/bin` subfolder of `areg-sdk`.

To obtain comprehensive information regarding **builds and options** for the AREG SDK, we recommend referring to the [Software build](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/wiki/03.-Software-build) page on the AREG SDK Wiki. This document provides a brief outline of the compilation process using **default options**.

## Integration[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#integration)

The *AREG SDK* provides developers with the flexibility to either build their own project on top of the *AREG framework* or integrate the framework into an existing project based on their specific project requirements.

### Integration into a Project

<details open><summary title="Click to show/hide details">Click to show / hide <code>Integration into a Project</code>.</summary><br/>

To integrate the `areg-sdk` into your project or start a new project using it, it is recommended to clone or copy the [`areg-sdk-demo`](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk-demo) repository template. When integrating `areg-sdk` into your project structure, you can simply set the `AREG_BUILD_ROOT` option in most cases. Here's an example of integrating `areg-sdk` into your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16.0)

set(MY_PROJECT_ROOT     "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}")
set(AREG_SDK_SOURCES    "${MY_PROJECT_ROOT}/thirdparty/areg-sdk")
set(AREG_BUILD_ROOT     "${MY_PROJECT_ROOT}/product")

include(${AREG_SDK_SOURCES}/CMakeLists.txt)

project(my_project_name)
```

Make sure to replace `"${MY_PROJECT_ROOT}"` with the path to your project's root directory, and `"${AREG_SDK_SOURCES}"` with the path to the `areg-sdk` directory within your project. This example demonstrates how to include `areg-sdk` in your build process using CMake.

For more details on integrating the AREG Framework into an existing project or creating a new project, please refer to the [Setup a project](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/wiki/08.-Setup-a-project) Wiki page of the AREG SDK.

</details>

### Starting a Project

<details open><summary title="Click to show/hide details">Click to show / hide <code>Starting a project</code>.</summary><br/>

To start a project, it is recommended to follow the steps described in the chapter [*Integration into a Project*](#integration-into-a-project) above. It is also beneficial to review the [sample projects](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/tree/master/examples) provided in the `areg-sdk` repository. For a step-by-step example and guidance on starting a project, refer to the [_Hello Service!_](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/docs/HelloService.md) document, which showcases various scenarios for creating *Local* and *Public* *Service Providers* and *Service Consumers*. Additionally, review the file structure guidelines presented in the [DEVELOP.mde](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/docs/DEVELOP.md) document.

To begin development:

1. Create a *Service Interface* XML document that describes the service, including data types, attributes, and methods. Then, use the provided [code generator](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/tree/master/tools) tool to generate base sources for the service components. It is recommended to include these generated sources in a *static* library that can be linked with each module.

2. Create projects that provide and/or consume services in AREG by extending the **Stub** or **ClientBase** objects and implementing the necessary overrides. For *Service Providers*, implement all *request* methods. For *Service Consumers*, it may be sufficient to implement relevant overrides for *Responses* and data update *Notifications*.

3. Define a *model* for your application(s) by describing the threads and dependencies between service components. Load the model in the `main()` function. Compile and link the projects with the *static* library of generated code and the `areg` library, which serves as the AREG communication engine.

> ðŸ’¡ The Service Interface design tool with a GUI is currently under development as an open-source project and will be included in the repository when it is ready.

The AREG engine facilitates transparent communication between *Service Providers* and *Service Consumers*, making it highly flexible and automated. In the case of *Public* services, the *Providers* and *Consumers* can be located on any software node. The AREG SDK introduces the concept of a *model*, which describes the service *Providers* and *Consumers*. These models can be dynamically loaded and unloaded during runtime, allowing for the activation and deactivation of defined services as needed.

Here's a brief example of defining a *model* that is loaded and unloaded during runtime, enabling **multithreading communication** between a *Service Provider* and a *Service Consumer* within the same application:

```cpp
BEGIN_MODEL("ServiceModel")
    BEGIN_REGISTER_THREAD("ProviderThread", NECommon::WATCHDOG_IGNORE)
        BEGIN_REGISTER_COMPONENT("ServiceProvider", ServiceComponent)
            REGISTER_IMPLEMENT_SERVICE(NEHelloService::ServiceName, NEHelloService::InterfaceVersion)
        END_REGISTER_COMPONENT("ServiceProvider")
    END_REGISTER_THREAD("ProviderThread")
        
    BEGIN_REGISTER_THREAD("ConsumerThread", NECommon::WATCHDOG_IGNORE)
        BEGIN_REGISTER_COMPONENT("ServiceConsumer", ClientComponent)
            REGISTER_DEPENDENCY("ServiceProvider")
        END_REGISTER_COMPONENT("ServiceConsumer")
    END_REGISTER_THREAD("ConsumerThread")
END_MODEL("ServiceModel")

int main(void)
{
    Application::initApplication();
    Application::loadModel("ServiceModel");
    Application::waitAppQuit(NECommon::WAIT_INFINITE);
    Application::unloadModel("ServiceModel");
    Application::releaseApplication();
    return 0;
}
```

For **multiprocessing communication**, the model can be split into two parts. One application loads the model to instantiate the *Service Provider*, while another application loads the model to instantiate the *Service Consumer*. Once the *Service Provider* is instantiated and available, the *Service Consumer* is automatically notified of the service availability and can initiate communication accordingly.

### Configuring the Multicast Router

<details open><summary title="Click to show/hide details">Click to show / hide <code>Configuring the Multicast Router</code>.</summary><br/>

To configure the _Multicast Router_, you need to adjust the [_router.init_](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/framework/areg/resources/router.init) file. Open the file and modify the following properties to specify the IP address and port of the `mcrouter`:

```
connection.address.tcpip    = 127.0.0.1	# IP address of the mcrouter host
connection.port.tcpip       = 8181      # connection port of the mcrouter
```

Please note that the *Multicast Router* is only necessary for applications that provide or consume _Public_ services (multiprocessing applications). If your application uses only _Local_ services (multithreading applications), you can ignore the Multicast Router configuration. 

The Multicast Router can run on any machine with a General Purpose Operating System (GPOS). It establishes a network between connected applications and is responsible for routing messages between programmable service components.

</details>

### Configuring Logging

<details open><summary title="Click to show/hide details">Click to show / hide <code>Configuring Logging</code>.</summary><br/>

To configure logging for applications based on the AREG framework, you can compile them with or without logging. If you choose to compile with logging, you'll need to configure the [_log.init_](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/framework/areg/resources/log.init) file to set logging scopes, priorities, and file names.

Here's an example configuration for the log file:
```
log.file        = %home%/logs/%appname%_%time%.log # creates logs in the 'log' subfolder of the user's home directory
scope.mcrouter.*= NOTSET ;                         # disables logs for mcrouter.

scope.my_app.*                   = DEBUG | SCOPE ; # enables all logs of my_app
scope.my_app.ignore_this_scope   = NOTSET ;        # disables logs for a certain scope in my_app
scope.my_app.ignore_this_group_* = NOTSET ;        # disables logs for a certain scope group in my_app
```

Please refer to the [AREG Engine Logging System](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/wiki/05.-AREG-Engine-Logging-System) Wiki page for detailed instructions on compiling applications with enabled or disabled logging, starting and stopping logs during runtime, creating and using logging scopes, and configuring the `log.init` file.

> ðŸ’¡ By default, the `router.init` and `log.init` files are located in the `config` subfolder of the binaries.<br/>
> ðŸ’¡ To enable logging for all applications, use `scope.*  = DEBUG | SCOPE ;`.<br/>
> ðŸ’¡ Currently, logging is only possible in the file.
