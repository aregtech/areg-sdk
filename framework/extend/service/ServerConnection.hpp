 * \brief   The Server Socket is used to accept connection from remote clients,

 *          the server specifies unique cookie for accepted client. After
 *          connection is accepted, the client starts to send and receive data.
 *          Sending and receiving data are running in blocking mode. 
 *          To synchronize communication, there are send and receive threads
