 * \brief   The Server Socket is used to accept connection from remote clients,
 *          send and receive data. When connection from client is accepted,
 *          the server specifies unique cookie for accepted client. After
 *          connection is accepted, the client starts to send and receive data.
 *          Sending and receiving data are running in blocking mode. 
 *          To synchronize communication, there are send and receive threads
 *          are specified.
