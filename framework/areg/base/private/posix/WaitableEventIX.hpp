/**
 * \brief   The synchronization event object. As a waitable object, the event has signaled
 *          and non-signaled state. When the event is in signaled state, all threads that
 *          wait for the signal are notified and released depending whether they wait
 *          for all events or any event. There can be 2 types of events:
 *              - Manual-reset: The Event remains in signaled state so long, until signal is 
 *                              manually reset. The signal and non-signaled states are set
 *                              by explicit call. Multiple waiting threads can be released
 *                              at the same time.
 *              - Auto-reset:   The Event remains in signaled state so long, until any waiting
 *                              thread is not released. As soon as at least one thread is released
 *                              the event automatically switches to not signaled state. Multiple 
 *                              waiting threads can be released at the same time. The threads are
 *                              released by priority order.
 *          A thread can wait for one, any or all events. For more details see @SynchLockAndWaitIX.
 *          If Event is in signaled state, multiple calls to signal Event are ignored.
 *          If Event is in non-signaled state, multiple calls to reset signal state are ignored.
