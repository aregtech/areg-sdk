/**
 * \brief   The synchronization waitable Mutex object is used to synchronize data access
 *          between multiple threads. If a Mutex is owned by a thread any attempts
 *          of other threads to take Mutex ownership will be automatically blocked and
 *          the threads will be stopped until Mutex is not released or the waiting timeout
 *          is not expired. There can be only one  thread at a time owning waitable Mutex
 *          and only owning thread can release the waitable Mutex to put to signaled
 *          state. The released state of Mute is considered as signaled and the thread
 *          owning state is non-signaled if it has mutex owning thread.

     *                      current thread. The waitable Mutex gets ownership by calling one of
     *                      wait methods defined in SynchLockAndWaitIX. Once the thread gets 
     *                      ownership, any further waiting functions calls of the same thread
